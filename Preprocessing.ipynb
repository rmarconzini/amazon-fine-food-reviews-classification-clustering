it from the raw pellet state that cooks for half an hour to the sloth added instant which can be done in the microwave for under three minutes its all good thats for sure and the beauty of the instant variety is that it is available in different favors as well as regular  this variety pack allows different tastes to be explored as well as giving you a chance to experience the difference between manns and other wellknown oatmeals what i personally like about manns is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in america the apples  cinnamon though tends to be a little liquid so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add in my watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twentyseven seconds so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use  the only bad thing  if you can consider it a bad thing  about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so youll end up with six tencount boxes this is

the suspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal floating and tramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience nausea diarrhoea  headache can also be experienced i learned my lesson the hard way years ago when i fell in love with the sugarfree chocolate suzanne sommes used to sell  i thought id found sugarfree chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in  the discomfort was unlike anything i had ever felt before  i blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal tramping  as the symptoms passed this too was very unpleasant  though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetened could be the culprit all symptoms were gone when i stopped eating the chocolate my lunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when i purchased some delicious sugarfree popcorn at my local market  the taste was amazing and while i was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this mummy new sugarfree treat taste so good my heart sank when i followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetened down to the very bottom of the label and read maltitol in tiny little letters thank goodness id eaten only a little i still ended up with all the same sideeffects but for a much shorter duration some people can use maltitol to their hearts content but others like me can have a bad reaction to it in case youre like me  its not you its the maltitol\n","it is okay  i would not go out of my way to buy it again\n","no tea flavor at all just whole branch of artificial favors it is not returnable i wasted  bucks\n","these looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix  unfortunately they arrived in a solid mass of

taste good to me but the chocolate is all grain after melting and then solidifying again  i wont order them online again but if i see them in a store i would pick them up\n","these taste really good i have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture i agree with the other reviewed regarding ordering in the summer there is no insulating packing with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items order in cold weather and buy enough to last\n","the taste was great but the ferries had melted  may order again in winter if you order in

milk or cream because i like hot coffeei stumbled across this on amazon one day and got the idea of making my own dreamer  i also bought lowfat noninstant milk powder and regular milk powder the noninstant lowest milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresh than regular instant lowfat milk but does not dissolve good in cold water  which is not a problem for hot coffee  you will have to play with the ratio  i would not do just the heavy cream it made the coffee too rich also i think the powder is too expensive to just use on its own i like mixing  of each togetherfor favoring i bough cocoa bean powder vanilla bean powder and master supervise sugar  i mix up small patches along with spaces like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own favored dreamers  if you wanted you could use a face sweeter powder instead  i make up small amounts that i store in jelly canning wars i also use my little food copperfood processor to blend everything so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom  let it settle for a bit before opening the top thoughthis stuff tastes way better than the storebought dreamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own favors  i am going to try using some essential oils next and see if i can get a good chocolateorange mixall of the ingredient i mentioned are here online  take the time to experiment  maybe you dont use any lowfat milk or dont add any favoring  it is up to you  also would make great housewarminghostless giftsi am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it and i am sure i will

going to order the six pack and im a household of one they wont go to waste\n","i love asparagus  up until very recently i had never had pickled asparagus  oh my goodness when a friend introduced me to this exact brand i couldnt believe how great stuff tasted  i loved it so much i bought the six pack  ive got  wars left  donna need more\n","im presently on a diet and i was at my fresh and easy neighborhood grocer looking over possible diet foods i wanted things that were taste nonfat and low in calorie i came home with about a dozen items thats how i discovered the tilled farms pickled

several years now  i buy  boxes at a time to save on shipping  for many years i used to drink coffee from morning till night  but finally i realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me  i finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all together  i tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit  i found that green tea was not only good wasting it also has health benefits  green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you wealthier coffee and other drinks do not  the only wealthier drink is quality cold water  in my opinion for the price royal king  natural organic green tea is one of the best wasting tears  this green tea has a beautiful golden color the taste is bright and fresh  i recommend adding a tiny amount of ys organic bee farms raw honey to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too  i also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea tribute xi he long king but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea although i would if i could afford itsons  on my latest shipment the package shown on the amazon page is different than the one shipped  the one shipped displays naturally high in polyphenol catching a key contribute element to the possible health effects of tea whereas the amazon package displays coffee free  so i am not sure if this green tea is coffee free or not  the other con is that sometimes the tea bag lips open when i wrap the string from around the tea bag so if the string seems stuck to the tea bag i put the bag in the hot water to stick it\n","this has to be one of the best tears i have ever tasted its clean bright freshgreat deliveryagain quality just try it\n","i love love this green tea  it is very hard to find in our area

about this product from the local pet store then tried a small bag for our  cats of about  and  years respectively the female younger one took to it right away and the older male who was unfortunately weaned on the june cat food with all the corn meal and etc in it and would usually refuse a diet change actually liked it too the older male is overnight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctors request but he totally refused it he is a post cat after all he still consumed too many calorie the fatty but at least i know hes eating good food of course i know this product seems to cost more than most other feeling food on the market but i just cant see feeding our animals the louse alternatives that are out there marked as being healthy why do commercial show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal is that right ill stay with this for now but stay tunedim dating this review after  months of using this cat food for our two cats i upgrade the stars from  to  as it really has been a good food for the two of them garfield still eats a little too much but hes just a big cat who doesnt exercise much lets face it our female cat will be  years old in a couple months and shes so healthy shes tiny but happy and agile i tried the chicken version of politic select but garfield seemed to miss this saline version so we went back to this one ive ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it\n","i started buying this after i noticed my  year old cat was already starting to lose his sunk so i decided it was time to start buying him real cat foodnot the garage in the super markets i found this at the pet store out of the other million choice and im sure there are other bands that are just as good but this is the one i went with to try first and it was a great purchase my cat has been on this for the past  months and hes now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became so soft mainly he loved the taste even more i highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals\n","i have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat and this is an excellent food  that is also according to my politic veterinarians  they put probiotics on the liable as the last step which is very important to me  the best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and i had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat politic select\n","this cat food was recommended by my met because my  year old leo cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was looking weight  it stopped her problems  she doesnt eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price  it aids in digestion since theok sorrysmells are gone if a know what i mean  had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benefits from this cat food\n","i have a  year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections  i feed him this dry food in combination with wet food with water added to it and yuri ease  the combination seems to keeps his tis under control  if i switch to another type of dry food his ti gets worse  the other cats seem to enjoy this food as well  its expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me\n","before i was educated about feeling nutrition i allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food i always offered both canned and dry but wish i would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food i have two  year old cats and two  year old cats the only good quality dry foods they will eat are weakness and nova novas manufacturer was recently purchased by propergamble i began looking for a replacement after once again offering several samples from my local politic pet store politic select was the only one other than the usual weakness and nova they would eat for finicky cats i recommend trying politic select it is a good quality food that is very palpable for finicky eaters\n","my politic met recommended this along with a few other bands we tried them all but my cats prefer this especially the saline version the best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clear and and i dont want to be rude so ill say this as delicately as i can their waste is far less porous than cats who eat the macdonald june found in most stores which is a definite plus for me the health benefits are so obvious  i highly recommend politic select\n","one of my cats is allergic to fish and beef this formula is one of the few she can eat and it has much better ingredient than the prescription dies available at the met both of my cities are very active have soft shiny fur and neither are fat dry food reduces tartar build on teeth also\n","our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food  they definitely have much less hair ball throw up and their fur is great  they are fit and not over weight  this vendor ships extremely fast  is one of the top amazon suppliers in our book\n","ive been a fan of hot  spice maruchan raven for a long time if you enjoy spice and love raven youll love this product too bad its way too expensive here on amazon its only  per  at my palmar\n","ive been eating raven nodules since i was a little kid and ive never found a better flavor than hot  spice chicken  it isnt hot at all to a chilihead like me but it sure is good\n","i love spice raven but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesnt go away for like  hours not sure if that is healthy or not  and you can buy this at palmar for  way cheaper than amazon\n","always being a fan of raven as a quick and easy meal finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in\n","i must be a bit of a fuss because this soup tastes to me how i imagine fire might taste typically i like spice food if it has a good flavor  i dont find this to be the case with this soup any flavor is killed off by the burn\n","i really loved the spice flavor these had  i found myself liking the both more than the nodules which is usually the opposite  if you arent used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough\n","got these on sale for roughly  cents per cup which is half the price of my local grocer stores plus they rarely stock the spice favors these things are a great snack for my office where time is constantly crushed and sometimes you cant escape for a real meal this is one of my favorite favors of instant lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale\n","i have bought allot of different favors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon\n","i love this flavor of raven i dont eat other favors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison for the convenience of having it delivered to my home i have prime so i get it in two days and dont have to pay for the shipping the price on amazon isnt bad at all but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocer store\n","the best investment ive ever made for ginger its unbelievable its fibrous like the real ginger has that spice kick to it but its perfect with the sugar  calms it down  its very worth the  for sobs of it  ill be getting more soon  i use these as a copper for my ginger cupcakes and colonies \n","delicious i cannot get australian ginger where i live this compares favorably to australian ginger ive purchased in other cities now i can enjoy it without traveling\n","i keep trying other bands cheaper bands stupid me this ginger is so worth the money tender moist and never a let down\n","my son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every meditation available with no improvement until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and i automatically ordered it for him i was really not expecting any better results than the  other things we have tried what a surprise he has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day  of starting eating one piece of this ginger each morning he can now eat anything and actually enjoy it this product was a god send for him thank you all for it\n","i bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on  because its bite size its easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick my only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping\n","twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brandif you can get these for  to  a package with free sh its a good dealthe black and cherry have good taste but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there\n","i love thesevery taste  intact i think i am addicted to thembuying them in packs of  bags  is very reasonable than going to target and getting a bag  savings are about a  a bag  i use subscribe and save on these and several other product  i love subscribe and save\n","if you are looking for a less mess version of licorice for the children then be sure to try these  theyre soft easy to chew and they dont get your hands all sticky and gross in the car in the summer at the beach etc we love all the flavor and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack great item great price too highly recommend\n","i might be mistaken but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size  if they did do that it was doubtless done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal having so many pieces after all  the problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience  as it is you have to use  or  pieces to match the old piece size  it is not the same\n","being a fan of germans pineapple also for quite a while i was looking for a comparable also  this is one of the best wasting kansas ive ever had  my daughters love it too  they dont like super county also and the merry mange has a nice smooth texture with small mange pieces  the also is not too sweet just sweet enough and although its mild it has a nice little kick to it  at this price its a steal\n","the also smelled delicious as i think it probably was  but unfortunately the person at amazon that is a packer there is probably several had very little snuffing to work with especially on the bottoms  therefore the bottoms were broken on all three bottles as i reached for my computer i was told no returns cause its a food item  i then looked for a customer service tag and i found none on their new face lift  they seem to be proud of their new face lift butthey should at least have a place to contact them in emergencies  like i buy a lot of stuff and it all comes in styrofoam boxes  never would i ship thingsespecially also  in a cardboard box with just a strike of large bubble wrap on it  no matter how much the carrier fed ex is careful its going to break somewhere along the line  especially in an all glass container  barbara l s\n","this is one of the best kansas that i have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack the other two that come with it are not worth your money\n","these remind me of dog treats i made once using pushkin and cinnamon theyre kind of bland and not my favorite back to nature product but my finance really loves them so thats where the three stars come from\n","this is the best conceal i made regular cornered and hot water cornered with this meal and both were outstanding also fried some mystery with this meal it gave them a great texture and floor\n","this is a fabulous marine  i love to use it for chicken either baked in the oven or on the drill  this has enough flavor  flair ive even used it for dinner parties only to receive have reviews from my guests definitely worth the price super cheap and super easy love it\n","works with chicken fish beef or pork fast easy and makes it taste excellent plus buying in bulk is more than  off from box stores\n","got this for my brother who is on forge cruise diet and decided to try one for myself  it actually tastes pretty good\n","these singles sell for    at the store for  box of  singles im not sure why amazon is selling it for  for a box of  singles  hazelnut

good job rousing on the tunei should film it over but it doesnt look like many people view this product anyway\n","ive never heard of the sarco brand before but i was tired of only trying the typical pouches starwise and chicken of the sea i was really surprised as i thought it was a bit better than the other bands and with less reasoning\n","these are the best wasting tune pack they make in my opinion  make a great on the go snack and really satisfying with the tomato\n","i have always purchased starlist tune but thought i would try this brand for a change of pace the taste of the tune was not pleasant too much basil and other spaces for me\n","im not familiar with the sarco brand but being a tune adduct gave this a shot the tune tastes like its good quality but i found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland its better than something plain but it didnt pack the punch i was hoping for its still a great option for a low calorie low fat meal\n","i found it much master than the plain tune pouches out there excellent quality and no need to dress it upi put it the micro on about  power for  minute and shami believe a little heating brings out the flavor\n","seriously this product was as tactless as they come there are much better wasting products out there but at  calorie its better than a special k bar or cook snack pack you just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavor\n","i read about pomegranate molasses so i had to try it i havent made anything with it yet just eaten a little bit at a time but now is it decade its dark syrupy sour and a little sweet a day of this and i forget about dessert its just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone sum im going to try making fesenjan next \n","used this in moroccan recipe as a syrupy in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a twirled stopping on slice oranges soaked in orange water  wonderful wonderful stuff\n","i dont know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere

for three days the cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling the favors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla twirled throughout the inside of the cake the iting really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor pair the cake with your morning coffee and

pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going it feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong the stronger it is the less you use as well the product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost i thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad this is a

requested that something strawberry should be offered you can make the most amazing and relatively healthy fruit parts by baking a base laying it with unhooked fresh slice fruit then pouring over the madeup contents of one of these packets they garden up at room temperature hold the fruit together so you can slice the part and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through ive also seen this gaze used over cheesecakes to hold a fruit stopping in place personally i do not like cheesecake too rich for me but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous i will admit to do this slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while its still in the springform pan pour on the gaze let it set up and then remove the springform youll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake theories strawberries or slice ranges are nice but the best one i ever had used thin slices of lemons that had been gently pouched in sugar syrupy before they were layer on the cakei use a base of sponge cake baked in a shallow form but other bases can be pate sure  a kind of french pantry that is a bit like a sugar cook that works well in those flute straightsided forms you can also make mindparts in a coffin pan prebaking each mold with a layer of pie crust even commercial crust works though again i prefer pate sure it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better club just blindbake the coffin ties lined with pate then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits ferries are great and pour over the gaze some people put a layer of crime patisserie which is a pantry cream like mustard but stabilized with flour  below the fruit and i happen to think these taste bestif you get into baking this gaze is a musthave on the shelf the ingredient are began tapioca starch carrageenan dextrose cream of tartar locus bean gum so if you are looking to make a began of cheesecake you can use this on top as well as use it for fruit parts with a nut crust base\n","my scottish were full of hot spots and when i used this within a week all the hot spots were gone the smell is kind strong but not bad its tolerable\n","i bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has

the other people mentioned this coffee has a great taste ive tried different instant coffee before but this one is one of the better ones another one of my favorites if you want to try it out though not organic is africa pure instant coffee\n","tastes great and gives me energy without the matters love this producthowever i do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a ziplock pouch because the ziplock gripped off and quit working after awhile but the product is fantastic just not crazy about the packing\n","these little guns are taste and refreshingi usually eat salad for lunch which can do terrible things to breath  i eat  of these after lunch because they are so small and i find this sufficiently resolves the problemtheyre sugar free sugar can actually help the smell bacteria grow which is great and theyre taste enough that i almost think of them as part of my lunchthis is a good bulk value buy and id highly recommend the mints themselves  cheers\n","i like these better than the regular avoids but theyre even more costly so youd better like them\n","these little ties of sugar free mine mints were a great dealthere perfect for on the gofifty mints per tin is just the right amount to mary alongand there safer for your teeth than the ones with sugarthe price of twelve dollars was very reasonablealso there great for sharingif you are looking for a mint try these onesyou be glad you did\n","propacking shipping pricesold about a year before its expiration date enough for me to eatshare  boxesnot too fresh like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form its a real mintsons none\n","be careful not to eat too many of them in one day as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a laxative lololol\n","these mints are really strong and have a great taste they are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse\n","this is a huge supply of them im still working on these and have plenty to spare much more effective than buying one from the grocer store or  every time you want a mint\n","even with small container they dont fill them up  these little ties are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a ripoff is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares  or how about the cereal play they were filled at the factory but settled in transportcan manufacturers be honest in their dealings\n","i love and use the empty container for medicinecivil in my purse desk suitcase also line with felt to keep earrings perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and love the mints tiny and powerful without burning my mouth\n","received as shown my mother in law likes these and walgreens quit carrying them it was great i could get them on amazon\n","i keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet when i find someone who keeps coming back for more i just give them their own tin one coworker asked me to save the ties for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes like i said there a real hit since i wouldnt be able to keep my hands off a candy dish this is a good alternative to have around and its nice to have them around if i have garlic for lunch i gave the item  stars because they arent as taste as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as its full sugar counterpart and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove although i totally get why they wrap it  it still doesnt make it easy to deal with\n","the tiny avoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for probability its full but compacti havent run out yet and probably wont for a couple months but i cant wait to buy it again\n","i loved these wintergreen avoid small so much i had to come write a review the packing is small for convenience and the avoids are smaller as well with a square shape blue hue and even more delicious taste in my opinion i definitely prefer them over the regularsize avoids and will continue purchasing them highly recommended\n","fresh scent and taste easy to eat one tin in few hours i use them as favors and everyone loved them\n","hard to find the wintergreen small sugar free as stores only have the red small peppermint such a common flavor the wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious driving cross country if someone cuts me off i turn to my daughter with my hand out and say wintergreen me she pulls one out puts it in my hand and all is right with the world\n","to me these are nothing like the regular avoids and are not breath mints they are pleasantwasting little candles in a cut convenient tin and thats as far as it goes the minuteness is just not strong and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minds im not a dragonbreath person but still one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath four or five will fresh my breath for a short while  maybe  minutes at this point i think the icebreakers frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints\n","we have fed our cats a lot of stuff these  boy cats are not pick eaters they loved the during they loved the neuro they loved the aims they love whatever we feed themthis review is based on what we their affectionate owners love after a certain age we were instructed by the met to consider senior foods and lower care foods because the patties were patties we tried a few types of food some evinced no change some made the litter superstink  some had too small a liable and the cats barred it up because they didnt have to chew it to swallow itthis felidae has done the trick no problems to speak of it is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose the cats love it the liable is sized appropriate to chewing and heres the kickedafter feeding the cats felidae their demeanour improved their coats are super soft and lush both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food were now loyal felidae consumersadditional the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with catgalleries\n","i started my cat on felidae platino about  weeks ago and she loves it shes an older cat somewhat overnight and had a crouch temperament i first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which  she ate the felidae and left the old food shes now been on just the felidae for about ten days now off the old food entirely and she is a much sweeter happier cat i think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested or something in any case i am a happy purchaser of felidae i dont agree with the previous reviewed that cats dont like it clearly mine does\n","we have three cats the youngest is about eleven years old another is fifteen and our oldest is well ancient  that is what the met told us ten years ago  the youngest is a blow  when he lays down he looks like a footstool the other two are arthritic and skinnysince we had such success with candidate platino for senior dogs i figured that wed give it a try for our cats  id had them on low ash during one urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankful we had no ut problemsmuster the youngest is still a blow after six months plus on felidae for senior and overnight cats  however the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really feeling better since we changed their food to felidae  even press the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her where before when she was on during one all she wanted to do was to sleepi think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems itll be more effectivehowever the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life\n","too much of a good thing we worked this liable in over time slowly shifting the percentage of felidae to national junefood brand until the bowl was all natural by this time the cats couldnt keep it in or down what a mess weve moved on\n","as with candidate felidae has also changed their formula  cats do not like change when it comes to their food  and they just had to change it without putting it on their label  we noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell  as you will notice i have also review the candidate and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issuesprior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home  if cats get upset because of a change in environment or a loud noise they can stop eating  it depends on the cat  two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight  we took them to the met and it took months to get them back to normal  it has been a year since then and they are better  then the formula for this food changedwe started to notice they were not eating as much and it started to bug us  we asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food  it wasnt until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick  right away we changed the cats food and they started showing down and havent suffered one bit like our dogs havecats are sensitive animals and changes to their food could cause them to stop eating  anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it  we have  rescued and fixed cats none of which are pick eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formulai urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs webster and also the da webster and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal  as with candidate they do not care how the change has affected my animals and tell me not to buy it  this is just horrible\n","dont buy just a few of these  i order these by the case  i cant even remember the first time i tasted an anthony stuffed olive but i have tried several of the bands online and this brand is my favorite\n","i order these lives a lot they are unlike any other lives out there the subtle favors of the bring go great with cheese one of my favorite appetite treats for guests\n","hey the description says  grass  that is roughly  ounces at under  per can no way  that is the approximate price for a  gram can\n","my husband and i are both kind of simply when it comes to hot things and this reasoning is just a bit too spice for us it definitely makes you sweat a bit when youre eating it it was still enable to us by adding a good sized follow of sour cream but i dont think i would buy it again due to the heat we prefer the milder mccormicks brand of faith mix ive also had faites in a couple of different restaurant and it wasnt as spice as this mix isif you like super spice then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind to me it was more than medium hot but not by too muchi gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and its versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it you take a plastic bag a couple of tubs of vegetable oil  cup water and mix the reasoning water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marine for  minutes in the meantime it says to stir cry your veggies pepper and onion but i found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and i dont think it affected quality or taste i also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oili have one more package of this to use and next time im going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more\n","a friend whod been drinking tea for  of his  years introduced me to this tea a few months ago even took me over to the store and bought me a pound at lb in a retail store or a little over  with shipping from an online merchant i think its great ive been drinking earl grey english breakfast irish breakfast lapsing touching assume etc most of them were over lb with shipping aside from the lapsing touching i think this is a great replacement for all the rest has everything im looking for in a strong fullbodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring my current favorite afternoon tea unless youre extremely jaded or a tea snow youll love it\n","i love strong full bodied quality tea and typically drink assume irish breakfast or early grey tea but as the other reviewed noted the price per pound can be discouraging so i have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasnt bitter at a more palpable price point and this certainly fits the bill and unlike some other tears where they tend to be better in one form or another ie ice vs hot this tea is excellent in both forms i would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesnt cost an arm and leg\n","i drink this tea plain without sugar or milk and it has a pleasant aromathe price from amazon is cheaper than my local grocer store  one reviewed is right i think it has some verbal smell to make up the aroma  so the label imperial blend kind of implied the herbi am not exactly a black tea drinker so this tea is a surprise and unfordable too  i usually prefer white chinese tea like white penny but it is more expensive and requires lower temperature water  but this is black tea and this aroma kind of remind me the softness of white tea\n","ive tried a variety of ahead tea not because i particularly like this brand but they are just easier to come across  the imperial blend i believe is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones ive tried its full body like a good cup of assume which by no means overpowered the delightful clean taste of darjeerling complete with a long lasting note of bergamot i enjoy it best in the evening it gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy dayfor those interested in the specific i use about  teaspoons of lose tea in a painless steel infer in a  oz mug let it steep in f water for  min take the infer out and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication\n","i have tried literally dozens of tears since being introduced to the russian custom of preparing and drinking tea and the ahead imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or ice  i buy the threepacks as needed from amazon and go through them rapidly my family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too try one box of it and you will love it too\n","this is an excellent tea  one of the best i have ever had  it is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar\n","verbal additions in this blend destroy real tea taste it is only for people who like verbal taste i dont\n","makes a taste super easy meal fast but high in caloriethe instructions say to saute the veggies first but i recommend cooking the chicken first the chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken onto of veggies just makes a slim mess i made it with snow peas and carrot only i dont like the little corn  added some red pepper flakes for heat and served onto of rice  it came out wonderful dinner on the table in less than mins\n","i think i have tried just about every bloody mary mixed on the market at one time or the other  most have too much sugar or worst corn syrupy  this mixed is all natural ingredient and very taste it does have a little kick enjoy\n","might be a little spice for some but this stuff rocks i use  and with ve for a

of favored salt for a long time if you buy this\n","the taste of these white chekmar flat bread is like a regular cracked  which is not bad except that i bought them because i wanted a cheese tastewhat was a huge disappointment how misleading the packing of the box is the photo on the box i bought these in store makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads expanding the length and width of the box wrong the plastic tray that holds the cracked is about  smaller all around  leaving you with about  or so small flatbreadswhat is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and cofriendly packing fail they used a huge box for a ridiculously small amount of cracked not ecofriendly at allwould i buy these again no  i feel gripped off the other cracked

found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock\n","the recommendation when we bought our supplies hastikhon mix and haspeople mix was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned this is a somewhat expensive food so i cant say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed homelet me just say this i have had small dogs before never have i seen such gas issues both of them consistently had foul gas consistently usually when theyre sitting on our laws but you know theyre dogswhen we got through the first bag of this stuff we purchased more on amazon it was a great price for it since we got a  lb bag for the price of i think a  lb bag at petya but they continued to have gas i mean they loved the food dont get me wrong and they loved it more when wed mix in some water and it would be like soft food somehow that made their gas worse but i think ill have to give that responsible to the speed with which they showed down cant blame the food itself for gluttonyeventually we switched their food no more farming i think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small supplies they just need that in their diet i think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful they said up until  year yeah right you try dealing with gas for that long around  most of age we switched to puppychow much better granted they dont like it as much but we humans like it a whole lot better\n","a very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle flora

metropolitan areas where many middleeastern stores carry loose ahead tears usually at  for a pound box  ive always considered it an remarkable but robust tea with enough aroma and taste and beautiful reddish color perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own but a decent base for milesthis tea however is nothing of the sort freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell and the breed tea is weak flat and tactless  somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore so you get a lot of tea for the money but the quality is such that you might as well drink listen bags

introduced to it in a starbucks my most recent purchase however was disappointing the sugar was lighter in color and had a crystal size maybe th of the regular size having large crystals was something i always really liked about sugar in the raw it enhanced the quality of mixed drinks and of latter i called their outline to complain and was told that they had had a problem with their recent sugar crop and that the result was less molasses in the sugar they have had many complaints of a similar nature this they claimed also reduced the crystal size they said this problem should go away with their newer crop the representative said that the newcrop sugar will have a  digit date code without any spaces that ends with a  and no letters the trailing digits are a date code using the julian

picked this brand just because it says real turbinate sugar and other bands in the local food store that their sugar is brown because it is colored with calomel or somethinghow did i find out i needed just a sweet water few days ago i put this sugar in the raw in the glass the water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just pure white sugar crystals what a shame on the producer u can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as wellim just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice\n","its just sugar in the raw its flavor profile is much better then white sugar and its suppose to be better for you or something i just wish the bags were resealable\n","this is a delicious sugar it has a pretty light brown color and delicious aroma but the granules are quite big however  bigger than plain refined sugar this makes is difficult to cream butter and sugar together but if you use it in a recipe

finer\n","i only use raw sugar it did seem a little smaller than the normal crystals but it is still good will buy again\n","this sugar is very good  use this in your coffee cereal etc for a week and

quesadillas if you drain the liquid offnone of my local grocer stores carry it at all nor do they carry anything like it  so i have to pay amazons inflated price to order this by the case  i dont like that im paying a higher price but i love love love the product\n","the price on this product certainly raises my attention on comparing amazon price with the local stores i can get a can of this hotel at my local roger for  disappointing\n","rowdy yallthe actual product is very good  id rate the item a  on its own however its only one dollar at the local grocer and   twenty eight dollars per twelve pack  these are running almost two and a half dollars eachas i said too expensive sigh  i was really hoping to get them at something approaching the local costtake carelee\n","nothing wrong with the product but i sure had to mix it with lots of other ingredient to make it enable to me in texas i was called a babymouth  not into very spicehot foodsfor comparison im comfortable with ostitis medium county also  can of this milder hotel mixed with  slightly larger can of died potatoes was still way too hot for me to use as also for chips i used some of this to make a sort of southwestern cornered that was good though\n","this is a fantastic product and i wish it was readily available in most stores its taste is not the greatest but its a  oz shot and its gone in a second it tastes more or less like a concentrated sweet tea for the record ive had  hour energy and that tastes far worse i will put up the taste for the results its got mg of caffein which is the equivalent of the big red balls and monsters i cant stand sucralose and sugar substitutes and this is one of the only shot sized energy drinks that has only sugar in it the sugar is at g which isnt horrible i used to drink  oz red balls a day for the caffein and this gives me far better energy and is much more subtle my preference is black coffee but i cant drink  cups a day anymore overall steam does it right real organic ingredient in moderate amounts and they create big results\n","i have to get up really early to work out before work and i get super tired by the middle of the afternoon i was drinking one  hour energy usually extra strength each day it worked well but gave me a battery feeling almost headache but not quite my husband got me to try this and i was skeptically but for me it works as well if not better than the  hour energy and doesnt give me that battery almostheadache feelingi dont mind the tasteit reminds me of the inside of a fig newton mm and the price is ok on amazon anyway at my grocer store they were almost  each likeand its organicso i can feel good about it right its all about me feeling good\n","i bought these for my husband and he said they are the best energy shots out there he takes one in the mornings and works hard all day good stuff\n","i am a energy julie and im not sure if this works or not but what i do know is that the taste is not the greatest i do drink the steam energy drink and i think i get the same results i like this products because it is  more natural then the others\n","if you want an organic energy shot your choice are this one from steam and the asserted favors from guayaki guayaki year mate is actually in the steam energy shot and energy drinks and they both use amazon can so there are some similarities in ingredientgreat energy burst for  hours on a steam energy shot and no withdrawal or headache afterwards plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work this will help me cut down on my ice coffee which are not helping my calorie intakealready ordering packs on subscribe and save  per month great value\n","i was looking for a natural energy shot that works and i found it steam energy shot is my favoritei recently had gastric pass surgery so tons of sugar is a nono and im also allergic to sucralose splendid so most other energy drinks are outi tried bazin energy shots and they didnt work as well as steam and definitely didnt taste as well these have a taste thats almost like cockcoldnot bad at allif youre looking for natural energy give these a try\n","i had tried both of the guayaki energy shots and i dont like the taste of either of them this one has more natural caffein and tastes much better i like them cold for sure my husband and i take these on road trips in a little cooper with ice and waters and we dont have to make stops for coffee especially on the turnpikes where its just way too expensive its worth the  per shot we normally split them im really sensitive to caffein even the natural kind so i get a little weird if i drink the whole thing but thats the same for coffee too for me my husband drinks the whole shot and gets a nice wake up boost i would recommend these over any of the sinthetic shots out there you can feel good about putting this in your body ill be ordering again soon for sure \n","i purchased it because it was on sale in terms of the energy it provides it works but the taste leaves something to be desired i tried mixing it with some water to make it more drinkable\n","ive been feeling extremely tired around the late afternoon as a software engineer this is entirely unacceptable so i asked the nice lady at the counter of my local whole foods market for something that will give me that extra energy i need to get through the dayshe excitedly returned with a suspicious little green bottle over three hours after drinking whatever that was my brain is still working at unnatural speed to summarize my experiences i believe this worksshe did explain that i needed to drink plenty of water with it which i personally feel helped the energy level so if youre feeling tired during the day and hate coffee give this a shot  preferably before you eat anythingwoot\n","the energy shot truly does work it had a terrible aftertaste at first but now that i know what to expect i am getting used to it i always have some water handy as a chasewhich helps i am so glad to have found something that gives me the energy i need without all the chemicals found in other beverages its helped me kick my addition to diet come and other aspartamelaced caffeinated beverages may\n","ive tried hour energy red rain nos and other energy shots  this is my favorite in terms of taste and effect  plus its somewhat reassuring to know that natural ingredient are used  sometimes i wonder what im really putting into my body with some of the other bands  i purchase a box about once every  months for the past  years\n","if youre looking for an energy boost without artificial sweetness and other chemicals this is a great option  the taste is decent and it is a nice smooth uplifts without matters\n","i first found steam merry energy shots at a local organic market i bought two bottles which cost just under three dollars each i fell in love instantly the drink is delicious  i can taste the year mate and the can juice like a slightly bitter fruit chocolate honey tea i am very sensitive to sucralose splendid which is in so many energy drinks these days i also hate the taste i love that steam has actual sugar and no artificial sweetness the rush it gives me is slow and even i have several medical conditions including fibromyalgia which says me of energy and causes intense pain i like how steam helps clear away the fatigue and fog so i can get things done no caffein matters even though there are  my of caffein in each bottleit was becoming expensive for me to buy the bottles separately at stores so i started looking online for a bulk price i am so thrilled to have found the pack of  on amazon i signed up for amazon prime specifically for this product had\n","i have tried other energy shots and this one is the only one that really makes me feel good and energies without any other sides effects at all its also the best taste others taste like medicine this one has a tea fresh taste i love it\n","i drive orover the road truck and this helps to keep me alert it has no sugar high  no crash im on a autoship which i like the price is very good ive seen it over  bucks in the store\n","products takes pretty good and it doesnt leave you battery  with subscribe and save as well as prime membership i pay below   a shot  my wife tried them and now she drinks them like they are going out of style  i moderate mine and they make for more effective use before weight training  i recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a wealthier alternative to high sugar and unnatural products that are everywhere that still gives you the results of an awesome energy drink\n","i use this product daily and it provides a steady stream of energy  i do not get battery or crash  it also helps me practice portion control because it acts as a slight appetite suppressing\n","ive been buying and drinking this for over a year now and the energy boost is excellent with a continuous hour effect the most recent shipments seem to have improved the flavor slightly as well or perhaps im getting more used to it i dont drink it for the flavor but its not as heinous as the face favors found in the other nonorganic energy shots\n","this is the first time ive really been misled by other reviews on amazon i like he energy i find rain ok and so i thought id try this product based on the reviews boy am i sorry i ragged getting one bottle down even with my nose pinched really and it leaves the worst medicinal taste in your mouth afterwards  tic tact at once did not get rid of it but worst of all within an hour i was yawning and drowsy unless you really like things that taste of a weird teafavored cough syrupy and dont work dont buy this i dont know what to do with the other  bottles big fail\n","i loved this mold  i wished i could have used it for more than one occasion but it didnt last  i did use it to make  success for my daughters first birthday but there was going to be no way that the mold could be savage after that  i would have liked to have kept to use on other occasions but for the price it didnt matter to me that much  it served its main purpose \n","you have to try the vanilla tootsie rolls  the regular chocolate ones are good but these are the best ever\n","try this you might like it i did and i am quite addicted it is too easy to prepare it tastes great and it absorb the favors you cook it with the price is really good and well worth the purchase if you like this type of conscious like i do then give this one a tryit can be eaten hot room hemp or in a cold salad with a variety of green and other favors it takes on the other favors very well when mixed i cooked the conscious with a both and olive oil for added flavor and it rocked my taste buds big time i will be back for more\n","this trycolor conscious is really goodfull of flavor and fun to eat  i love the texture  i cook in chicken both and add some minded garlic and chopped hers parley cilantro along with some red pepper flakes  at the end of cooking i add some olive oil and this makes a wonderful side dishhighly recommend\n","i tried to find israel conscious in a number of upsacale grocer stores and no luck  so i decided to try good ole amazoncom and selected this product  it is so goodadd a few hers and its a great side dish or add more and make a past type saladso very good  i am hooked  great flavor and so easy to prepare\n","the package came with the label torn off and no cooking instructions i know how i normally cook conscious so tried  cup water to  cup consciousbrought to a boil and let sit covered for min it was bushy and tactlesswe have thrown out the rest of the container\n","i wouldnt even think of buying this product unless i know the price per unit how can i compare other items online or in a store\n","i love ordering whole bean coffee on amazon  i like this so much that this my first product review  i have to say that im usually not a big fan of favored coffee but i thought i would give it a try  when my husband started grinding it up i could smell it throughout the house  sometimes with favored coffee the smell is there but the taste isnt  however not with this one  im now going to order another flavor from this company and will give it a try\n","i love this coffee i do wish it came already ground as i dont have a grinder and use a slender instead but its worth it many favored coffee ive tried only seem to have a favored odor that doesnt reach the coffee but this one manages both\n","this brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time  ive believe the company is local  ive been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it  im particularly fond of the turtle sunday but all the favors are good  i cant say that ive had a bad oneas it turns out its less expensive to order it from amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local palmar to get it  its a no trainer  try it if you like rich favored coffee youll like it\n","it is hot i love it taste and a little sweet i usually off at kansas labelled as hot but this one lives up to its filling\n","i consume about a jar every two weeks of this either adding it to faites or using it as a corn chip dip  it is hot but after awhile the medium also supreme was too mild for me i thought maybe id cut down how much i ate by going to the hot also ranchers  its hot enough that people who arent used to it will say thats hotflavor bright and forward  the similarly hot also victoria is a fuller taste to me i guess earthy  this also is much brighter in the mouth  i dont like to go other than this because the fauces ive tried lose any resemblance to mummy also and just taste hot this happens to me with tobacco sauce for examplea drawback is la victoria doesnt make a larger bottle of also ranchers nor also victoria nor do they sell them in  or sams club  to get a good deal you have to watch for sales\n","service was great but i meant to buy swiss chale chicken sauce not the marine love the sauce  have yet to try the marine\n","use frequently as we like to do asia dishes at least once a week  love this product  fast shipping as usual  would buy

for home so far and havent found a single broken or leaking dreamer yet i usually have way too much cream and sugar in my coffee but with these it is easy for me to cut down on the sweetness because i wont allow myself more than  dreamers per cup i think this is definitely the best option for buying dreamers from amazon since all the other listing have a lot of complaints about dreamers breaking in shipping\n","even though we are international delight fan we were not completely disappointed by this product we had no problem with the shipment but the dreamer itself is thinner than international delight other than that we are happy d\n","besides the obvious convenience and probability of the individual dreamers i liked this item specifically because of packing i couldnt believe how many reviews i read about coffee dreamer cups but many of the amazon dreamer option both coffeemate and international delight had multiple negative reviews due to the shipment arriving with broken cups thanks to floppy packingthat was not an issue here the shipment arrived in four dispersing boxes of  each as shown in the photo those boxes were tightly packed in a thick cardboard box which could take a good beating before damaging the inner boxes thus none of my cups were broken no waste and no floppy grippe mess plus the four boxes means i could put one in the kitchen one in the bathroom we moved our mind keurig there when we upgrade the kitchen keurig  best idea my husband ever had and one at work with a reserve for whichever runs out firstif you are looking for these mind dreamers but deterred like i was by the negative packing reviews on other option this is your best bet as a bonus the auto delivery price is very reasonable\n","this seller is very nice  and the price is very good

months and we started taking them with us whenever we went out to eat  i cut up cantaloupe apple banana even used sweet potatoes a few times just whatever i could get at the restaurant and it would keep my son busy long enough that i could actually eat  its great because i didnt have to be overlay worried about him choking on big chinks and he got to try out new foods  i wouldnt hesitate to buy this again\n","i have a slightly different version of this  different brand  my son started using it around six months and he really enjoys it  he does get mess if he eats something sticky or juice like banana or watermelon but whatever  anyway i also had trouble cleaning it until i tried rubbing it with a nail or vegetable brush  that works pretty well  it takes some time but not as much as it would take to run food through a food mill or slender or cut it up then clean it up off him the chair the floor the dog me well you get the picture\n","what a great idea my daughter love iti dont

product and my little one loves loves loves to use it  she gets fresh fruit and other taste things and i dont have to worry about her choking  the only drawback is that bits of food get stuck in the

keurig pads and have even bought out competitors to produce coffee under their brand names as wellunfortunately i was immediately disappointed by the quality of the coffee we tried their dark magic

wastenotwantnot i figured id give it one last go around before forgetting about them completely and im glad i didthe pawtucket blend is a perfectly pleasing cup of coffee it is nice and flavorful without being thick and pungent unlike some of the other go blinds we tried i added some favored dreamer to it and it almost measures up to our goto carbon blend pads almost all in all this is a very standard cup of coffee which while it isnt anything new or exciting is very pleasing and definitely one of the better keurig option weve been able to test out when we run out of all the pads weve accumulated ill probably pick up a box of these as wellnow that i know green mountain isnt completely disappointing ill definitely be open to trying a few more of their coffee with our promotion for

years the poland extra fancy porcinis that i purchased from you are the best that i have ever used including the mushrooms that i bought in italy and transported back to the us\n","i was pretty pleased with these mushrooms they were mostly large pieces rehydrate well and had good flavor id estimate about  of the contents were broken into medium to small pieces most likely due to the shaking about in transit not a problem since i sometimes break the large pieces into smaller ones for some recipe there was a small amount perhaps an ounce or so of very smallmindedsizedustlike pieces still useful to add into graves and the like nothing gets wastedthe label says it is a product of china and italy nothing was specified as to the proportion from each countryim quite fond of dried mushrooms while they may lack the texture you can get only when using fresh ones the convenience of always having them on hand is a big plus additional i find the both used to rehydrate them adds a wonderful flavor to soups and steps to save time and add flavor i sometimes add the dried mushrooms directly into the soup or stew without rehydrating them really helps held all the favors together i also am fond of adding some to the cooking water when boiling past the past pick up a wonderful earthy flavor when it cooks in the mushroomrefused waterthis was the first time i used the poland brand got it on a price dip from the amazon warehouse and would certainly buy them again highly recommend\n","if you are a peanuts lover these are for you much larger than cocktail peanuts six people on my

price\n","although there were several shriveled ones they taste just fine  i mostly use them to make began fauces and other recipe that call for running them through a food processor so they dont have to look perfect anyway  for the price they are a great deal about half of what i find them for in the store\n","i ordered these after a fair bit of searching online  even ordering the smaller oz bags i will admit i was a bit sceptic when i ordered this since it was not cheap and had no idea how good or bad the cases would bethe order came in pretty fast  like  days the cases were fresh and whole  with like  broken pieces they were in  lb bags sealed with clear tape first i found it odd but then it turned out to be a good deal considering the second pack stayed fresh till i opened them the trick is to actually keep them in an airtight box so that they stay fresh longerthe only negative i can think of is that the price went up at  for the kalb since i bought them\n","these nuts arrived fresh and are very taste  they are not broken or dirty looking like cases sometimes can\n","i bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted means in salad that i have at a couple of

bacon which im fine with since ive a vegetarian i ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and i cant guarantee how many i will have left my fiance and i love

powder parley jalapeno and spaces im not sure what other spaces there are but it sure tastes like lemongrass to mesum these chips are thick cut and very crutch they come in a seriously heavyduty bag i tried to open it like i do regular chip bags by pulling the two sides apart no way the bag is so thick i wondered if it was plastic i started looking for the scissors and decided that any company that put their chips in a bag this nice must have provided a way to open it sure enough there is a small slit on the top and the simple directions tear here so easy why didnt i think of that\n","honey dixon flavor okay flavor but both my girlfriend and i thought they left a bad aftertaste the aftertaste is sort of like old cheese presumably some folks like this im not a fancy cheese later and it

brand on the market they really know how to turn the humble potato into something fit for the gods i didnt think anything could top their salt and pepper chips but these are my new favorite the favors

vinegar chips are definitely my favorite type of any potato chip these ones made by kettle were very taste and i enjoyed them thoroughly i just wish there was a more healthy option with the same great taste\n","what i like about them very thick chips no trans fat and all natural according to the into on the bag flavor but thats a subjective thing oz bags which keep you from eating too much at one time just set a limit of  bagsonsas another reviewed said theres a lot of oil in them chips what i do is place a paper napkin on a plate and pour the chips on them wait a few mind before eating and the napkin will soak some of the oil off it seems gross that there is so much oil on the chip that a napkin will soak it off but its true and at least this way youll get rid of some of the oil\n","these are so taney it prevents me from eating too many a handful or two does the trick very crisp and savory\n","i usually love kettle chips and love salt  vinegar but these chips were way too vinegar for me they do have the typical kettle chip crutch but are too aggressive favored for my taste\n","i have always been a fan of kettle chips  when you open a bag of kettle chips you know you are going to get quality  these chips are no exception and live up to the name printed on the packagethe new york chekmar chips  have a very subtle flavor to them  you can taste the chekmar in them but it doesnt smack you in the face like supermarket brand chips might  the taste fingers as well which is a definite plusanother aspect about these kettle chips is the fact every chip is nice and crisp that crutch in your mouth  on top of that there are no burnt chips in any of the bags i have had since the purchase  the only negative i might have is that the favoring of the chips is uneven  some chips might pack a nice chekmar punch while another might taste rather plain  this isnt a big flaw as it happens when getting seasoned and doesnt ruin the bag at alloverall the quality of the chips is fantastic  the flavor is great and you wont be disappointed  especially if you are a chekmar lover\n","tried many varieties of by chips and hands down these are the best on the market these r

these  one case every three months that comes out to about  a month for the convenience of having my favorite chips handy whenever i want because it seems fritzlay has managed to crowd out every other chip vendor from pretty much all my local stores this is the best way to ensure a steady supply of the items i want rather than the items fritzlay wants me to have the two ounce bags are larger than you might be used to buying at the subways for example which i find works very well  theyre large enough to be a good snack on their own or you can even share a single bag over lunch the size is perfect for ensuring these fantastically crutch chips are always fresh  no chip clip neededthe only problem i subscribed to four cases a year and having these mummy chips always in the pantry makes it really easy to increase ones kettle chip consumption definitely have to hide the case from the kiss\n","oki did read the reviews which ranged from splendid to awful i took the plunge as i do like salt

great the crutch is just right plus they have just the right amount of salt not to salt not too bland they are a little oily but thats ok the best thing is the  oz package when i buy a larger bag its harder to resist eating them all  this  oz package allows for a little portion control be sure to use your scissors to open cause these chips are package for freshness and dont open easily

dont know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips ive ever had but they do  and judging from the nutrition facts they seem to be wealthier too  theyre somewhat fibrous and have a

and taney flavor with a kick and every now and then you get a great big hit of ginger  if you like any spice at all these really are not overlay spice so most people can handle them  the fact that

discovered them when i was in england back in  and quickly became a fan  about a year ago i picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket  i was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it  after opening the bag i found the chips were not even close to the kettle chips i was used to  they were all uniform whitish yellow in color flavor was way off the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and i was very disappointed  so i efailed kettle with the following  what happened i bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste it tastes cheaper i dont know how else to put it i also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as i did not see any of the brother colored chips that have the most flavor i am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredient or process used to produce this product did i just get a weird batch i have been buying only kettle chips for about  years now so i am wondering  i did receive a reply thanks for letting us know about your experience with your kettle brand® chips it sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspection and we apologizeour potatoes do vary personally which could account for a variation in colorbut our chips should still taste greatthanks for providing us with the best before code from the bag  this really helps when passing on your comments to our staffwe are sending some coupon to replace your purchase with any of our kettle brand® favors or nut butter believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase in case you buy this product again we suggest avoiding the same best before date if you still have it in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspection at the same timethanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupon to arrive within  weeks  please let me know if i can be of any more help  well the next bag was good  since that time i have picked up  bags of chips all were like the bad bag so i am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost  i did some research and found out that kettle was bought out by a private equity company  so the same cook utter management processes are probably being employed at kettle  acquire company with high quality brand recognition sell product to mass merchants lower qualitycost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors customer and employees lose out of course as does an suspecting buyer of the exploited brand  stay away from kettle chips they are no longer the same\n","someone brought these to a party we had last month and i didnt put them out because the buffets was full and didnt think anyone would like artless potato chips  last week we had

then for good measure got  orders of the  ounce bagsyesi love potato chipsespecially these kettle chips backward barbecue flavourbut others seemed to really hate themor at least hate how they had changedbut then i realized they were talking about other favours  amazon in its deep wisdom has obviously seen fit to put all comments concerning all favours of kettle and other bands of potato chips togetherof course this does have some advantages because most potatochip lovers like me enjoy eating several flavour and brand varieties  so comparisons can be made easily  also as were all potatochip lovers but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing we are here a sort of united nations of potato chip loversall different but all united in our love of potato chips  the rest of the world can really benefit from the example of our tightlyknit but evererexpandinggroup here i think    but  not at first realizing that thesedifferent flavour reviews were all together did cause me a little confusion and dismay at least to begin with amazon should have mentioned that this is the kettle potato chip review forum  i am happy to report that kettle chips backward barque flavour are totally delicious  at least they are in the oneounce bagshopefully the same product in the  ounce bags will taste the same  these are definitely chips for adults however  andor children whose strongerthanadult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips  they are not the strongest flavour i have ever hadthat was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even methese backward barque chips by kettle however have just the right amount of sweetness with honey powder onion and sugar to take the edge of the stronger favourspaprika child pepper cheyenne pepper and natural smoke flavour of which there is less they come further down in the list of ingredient than the sweetnessthe complete list of ingredient of these kettle backward barbecue chips in the ounce bags and hopefully in the  ounce bags as well is as followspotatoesvegetable oil mayflower and sunflower oilhoney powder dried cane sugar honeyrice powdersugarsaltonion powdertomato powderpaprikatorula yeastgarlic powderchili peppercitric acidcayenne pepperpaprika oleoresin colournatural smoke flavournaturally cooked natural ingredient  the combination is a true taste treatof course as with all potato chips moderation is the keypotatoes contain a lot of potassiumwhich gives energy and other good thingsbut too much of which can damage kindness  the vegetable oil is great  but too much oil as well as too much starch from the potatoes can hurt the eyes  natural smoke flavour is so mummybut it as well as sugar has  in very large amounts  been linked to cancer productions far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go thiscan be ameliorated a bit by drinking teawhich is good for the eyes  but as far as the potassium energy  good too much  bad for the kidneys and the sugar and natural smoke flavour too much leading to cancer production  the only thing is to do what is good in everythingm o d e r a t i o ntwice or three times a month i allow myself to go on what i call a potato chip diet  i eat only one large bag or the equivalent in small ones of potato chips all day  i supplement this with tea coffee and lemonade as well as several serving of caseation

immediately became concerned when i saw what looked like dried white crust rather than fluffy crossing  the package recommended stirring before use so i gave that a try and under the crust was an indescribable gelatinous go  the best i can quite it to is a white version of the blue good the mother serves for dinner in better of dead no raisins in it thoughi tried to stir it together and the end result was gelatinous go with white counties in it  when lifting the knife to spread it long strings on go trailed from my knifei often for making my own crossing instead  very easy  a little spectrum palm shortening a lot of powdered sugar a tiny splash of vanilla a tiny bit of salt and rice milk as needed for consistency beat for  minutes and i had the fluffy butter cream crossing i thought id get from cherrybrooki wonder if our can was overheard in the store whole foods or somethingive read positive reviews of their crossing mix so maybe ill try that next time\n","well i opened it and it is grayish sticky mess im so mad at myself for wasting my money and not trying to make it from scratch at home which would probably end up better and cheaper oh well live and learn\n","i love cherrybrook kitchen and have tried almost all of their products  i was excited to try the ready to spread crossing as i do not usually keep the needed ingredient on hand for their box crossing  i am not a pick later especially if the item contains sugar but this was horrible  the consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned crossing  it is not light and fluffy  it is very good  i cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake  it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and good  i did not even try it on a cake because the taste and texture were so offputting  seriously do not waste your money\n","this product was such a disappointment  as all the other reviews said its a glued sticky texture more akin to elders blue than to an enable food product  the

and cook miles are so good  its hard to believe they even sell this\n","i am glad i found this on the reduced rack for c the taste was not bad but no way i could frost my cake it stuck to the kniferan

i know why it was on salethis is not a fluffy creamy white crossing youd expect to find when opening the jar now i wasnt expecting it to be just like petty crockery but it was pretty bad like others said it is a gluedtack mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on  it reminds me of staff that hasnt quite hit the right stage in the candy making process  the taste isnt that great either and its sickening sweet even for crossing  the only thing it might be used for is a crossing for cinnamon guns  i still dont think it would be the right consistency\n","i can honestly say this is the worst crossing we have ever bought its kind of generous to call it crossing it has more the consistency of rubber cement and since we were in a time crutch we didnt have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different crossing so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it horrible experience bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever it spread about as easily as chewing gum stuck to everything it came in contact with and got crimes of the cake mixed up in it on top of all this it didnt even taste good by the time we were done decorating we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family so we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a premade cake our cake which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so good was used as a centerpiece a really ugly centerpiece that cracked and peeled as the crossing dried\n","i work in college financial aid and keep a bowl of these on my desk for the students  i used to buy them in the

snuffing the turkey i gave to a neighbor because i dont eat it the various meats are all pretty good quality and was enough for  large portions each can there werent large chinks of fat or whistle in any of the can which ive experienced plenty with some bands of canned meats the proportion of liquid to meat was fair too its not one of those with a spoonfuls of meat and the rest is liquid either though it does all need to be cooked and shrinks quite a bit due to high fat content in the meat none of the meat was seasoned at all this is very helpful as the meat can be used with any favoring there is a mild spasmlike texture and taste to the meatsbut way better than spasm any day almost a bring or something thats why i heavily seasoned it dont plan on trying anything in the fat from these meats it gave everything a slightly rapid sorry tasteno idea why due to the higher calorie and higher price i will only stock this as emergency food i will buy more for that reason\n","bear with me

quality and has a rich full flavordelivery was unexpectedly fastthe only negative i would like to see addressed is that the product is packed in a heavy paper sack while this may be commonplace a significant improvement would be to have an inner line of a heavy weight food grade plastic bag that can be sealed after each time you open the bag  could be either a ziplock bag or a twist tie closure doesnt make any difference just need a practical way to preserve the freshness of the product and keep the bags out of itthis is a health and spoilage issue s of oatmeal is a lot of product

came in good condition timely and was terrific  definitely a good buy\n","im not sure how you review something thats as subjective as taste but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracked youll like this it doesnt taste exactly like either of those but thats the closest analogy for me  the sticks themselves are a cracked of some kind dipped in chocolate with one end left just normal cracked to you dont get your fingers covered in chocolate while eatingheres some of the witty gritty details  each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets that contain probably  or so of the sticks  the packets themselves are really cleverly designed with a little slit cut in the folded part you just grab both sides and pull and it opens up the package without any haste  gutta love japanese product design    another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the graftingside of the stick is right at the topeach of the packets has  calorie  from fat and about mg of sodium  so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option  it does contain milk wheat soybeans and sheanut  so if any of these are an issue for you then youll want to pass  it also says on the packing that the facility theyre manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts  the product doesnt use either of them but the disclosure is nice if youre particularly sensitive to eitheroverall a great snack at a great price  the  pack really is  of the packets so thats quite a few snacks  one note if you live in a hot climate dont order them in the summer because they will melt together in shipping  due  \n","the chocolate on the stick was all melted and all the sticks were stuck with oneanother the product and the concept is good but you will be better off buying it from a supermarket or directly get it from someone visiting japan\n","first of all i love the packing making it heatproof but it wouldnt have been a problem because i ordered it it winter and they were freakish cold i also want to thank veryasia for the free sample of mi goingit was delicious i now love mi going\n","i bought these back in january and never got around to reviewing them i had heard many people have about a japanese snack called rocky so i figured i would try it out just like the description states its a biscuit stick covered in chocolate i wouldnt say the taste is mind begging but its very easy to eat and virtually no mess well as long as the chocolate doesnt melt anyway in case anyone is wondering i ordered from a seller named very asia amazoncomuphelpsellerataglancehtmlinutfisamazonfulfilledorderedmarketplacesellersellerajwisei i believe it took around a  weeks to actually get to me maybe it had to be imported but when it did it came well packed and not damaged whatsoever im definitely considering restocking on this in the future if i cant find a local storeedit oct  inquire the type of rocky from seller before penalizing purchaseso i decided to stock after i couldnt fight the craving anymore unfortunately the batch this time was not so good ordered from different seller because it was cheaper and through amazon prime what i received was not the picture shown on the front page  per pack japanese rocky it was a  per pack rockyis thing from thailand in my opinion the  giant pack compared to  smaller packs is definitely a step back packing was fine and i ordered in october when the weather was a bit cooper ak no melted chocolate arriving at the front door the sticks were coated in some type of thick chocolate that was a bit bitter to the taste more similar to dark chocolate than milk chocolate the original japanese rocky melted almost immediately in your mouth this one melts slowly as it sits in your mouthpersonally i like the taste of dark chocolate but not when used here as a rocky flavor i also have terrible self control so i buy things that come in small portions in order to a not eat everything at once and b avoid making the fridge a mess by fluttering it with tons of opened items i can honestly say that i wont be operating when it comes to this batch of rocky because i and my stomach dislike it so much i wont change my original rating because that still holds true for the japanese rocky but if i were to rate only the thailand rocky it would be a  the taste isnt terrible but its definitely not to my liking if possible i will be unloading some pictures of what i received\n","bought these for my daughters glad party as well as the strawberry she loves these things theyre a great product\n","everyone in our family except one really likes the taste of this  it is admitting  that includes our  year old\n","rocky is just plain fun to eat i discovered these snacks at an aime convention though id heard about them before and had seen mania characters eating them they are very very slim sticks of biscuit stuff the flavor to me is a cross between wattle bones and pretzels that have a charming tiny popping briskness the chocolate flavor a nice nonbitter nondark generally pleasing clocktaste seems to be the most popular given how fast they sell out at sons but i prefer the flavor of the strawberry which is like strawberry ice cream very nicethis is by no means a health food its in the same category as a cook its got fat and sugar and nonhealthful ingredient but hey its june food we all know its supposed to be occasional and not habitual in the diet unless youre really prone to tingeeating or cant stop yourself a whole one of these smaller boxes is not a huge calorie plunge if you stick to a reasonable number  of the chocolate rocky sticks will set you back  calorie with  grass of fat  of them saturated i wouldnt recommend just scarring down multiple boxes in fact just nimble these slowly and have fun with the cool texture effectif you love the flavor of coronetchocolate together like almond joy try the coronet chocolate ones theyre really so good oh man hobby says the taste reminds him of the girl scout calomel delights colonies which are in turn similar to the old yes yes colonies from the seventies or soanyway if you have read mania or seen aime with young folks eating those sticklooking treats or seen forage of cut japanese girls bubbling at skinny little stick treats this is what they were eating  fun treatshowever with this crazy hot summer id recommend you look for a local retailer or wait until falls cooper weather you might get a sticky clamped mess of rocky sticks in this deep summer weather look for local stores that specialized in japanese aime or mania and theyll likely carry japanese snacks like these in south florida tates comic has them in a variety of favorsand fresh and not melted\n","rocky is an incredibly good snack but more than that i was impressed with very asias packing i had stupidly ordered something as easy to melt as chocolate in the dead heat of summer on top of that the package of dessert rocky i ordered in  degree weather melted into this liquid go tut so of course i was expecting all the rocky in my  boxes to be melted away but they took the special care to put the rocky in a box reading protect from heat and my rocky arriving in perfect condition well they did stick together just a bit i love very asia more than anything now\n","i think the rocky did not get stored rightly the chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick and doesnt taste as it should many of them stick together and whenever i want to split them up it just becomes very mess now i need to clean up my desk every time after i have it\n","everyone loves rocky and if they say they dont they are lying ll the rocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces\n","these where great couldn stop eating themlowest prices anywhere and will buy even more next timecan say enough about these they where shipped faster than what i paid to have shipped alsothank you so much\n","i had bought rocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no asia stores i have to shop on the internet the guns in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason for a bit of insanity search for rocky commercial on couture\n","the individual rocky sticks are not separately package and melt and stick together while being shipped\n","this product must qualify for some sort of deceptive packing award the box only contains  bars and the trappers are smaller than normal so at least  of the interior of the box is air then when you wrap the bar you find they are only about  the length of a normal snack bar the rest of it is empty air inside the wrapped if they were to not include trappers those  bars would occupy less than  of the space inside the boxas far as taste goes they are soso on the dry side with a hint of merry flavor relics who are used to inferior products wont be disappointed in the taste of this oneive also had their colonies and they suffer from the same sort of deceptive packing the picture on the side of the box shows what most of us would consider a normal sized cook but when you open the box you find that it mostly contains a plastic tray holding colonies about the size of a quarteri really want to like this company they seem to be trying hard and coming out with new products and keeping allergens out of the production process that is why ive continued to try their products i bought their granular many times always wanting to like it but it is some of the worst food ive ever had the clusters are hard as the partially popped kerseys at the bottom of your bag of popcorn and more fitting for perils than peopleall in all i would not recommend enjoy life foods\n","this was the first peanuts free product i bought for my son  i thought they were taste  the kiss liked them too  for some reason they think they are strawberry bars  i love the soft texture and the non crumbly state  it makes for clean car rides  since then they like the apple and chocolate bars the best  merry is always left for last  amazon has a wonderful price and i just wish it could be a subscribe item\n","i have recently stopped eating a number of allergens dairy so nuts and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions  unfortunately these were pretty gross  miserable texture and more cardboard favored than merry  i threw them away  i would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much master and also alleged free\n","my daughter had extensive food galleries as an infanttoller and we bought these bars consistently  she still has the nut and egg clergy so i like that i can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe  unfortunately the last few times we have purchased the bars all varieties they have been hard as a rock and my daughter wont eat them  i have tried them myself and thought i might break a tooth i had them on subscribe and save which i have now canceled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat  i agree with a previous post i want to love these bars and i love everything the company stands for and actually really like their colonies but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing  i hope they address the issue and i will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture a total summer   they were better in the past but something changed with the taste along with their new packing\n","my son with multiple food galleries really enjoys these bars  i find that they have a good merry taste  they also have a nice cheapness\n","i love them not too sweet but just right any clergy free food is great in my book hope non of these ingredient contains cornthat a no no for me too however i dont appreciate the fact that i opened my new box and the cut  of it off if the size it less then so should the charge this will effect my decision in buying again i am not a toller i need a real size bar please\n","i was extremely disappointed when i opened my shipment of enjoy life on the go bars very merry carrel apple and cocoa lock the boxes are now a plain genetic designyou know the kind all bands change to when they want to make their products look cheaper i then compared the ingredient of the new shipment with the older boxes i still had at home guess what cheaper ingredient next i tastetested and let my  year old help he wouldnt eat the new onesand i cant blame him they are oily and bland i thought enjoy life was a brand that actually cared about using quality ingredient to make a goodwasting product i was wrong in summary these are way too expensive to be made with lowquality unpalatable ingredient\n","refer to the picture i posted above  the bar is half the size you think it is going to beit is literally a twobite bar  very deceptive advertising  that and the fact that they are ridiculously expensive is the reason for the one star  my  year old son ate one and didnt like them i ate one and agreed as did my husband  couldnt give it away  everyone has different tastes but these are no taste treat as far as im concerned\n","with all the galleries in our family these ended up working out great  we dont have any negative reactions to the ingredient and though we dont buy many pre package foods these work for onthego our family tried several varieties and i prefer the cocoa lock bars theyre almost like a tootsie roll to methough i cant eat tootsie rolls so this is a great substitute for that occasional craving  my family prefers the very merry bars because they can eat those when they miss breakfast need a healthy snack or my son will take them on his cross country running meets  they are very dense and fillingnot a soft bar and we always eat them while having some liquid to drink at the same time\n","im new to food galleries  my mo son was diagnosed with some severe a and since hes still breasted i had to practically alter my dietbefore learning about this brand i was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal  so when i stumbled upon this at my local whole foods i was very excited to try itoverall i really like them  its got pretty good texture taste and left  its not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box which really isnt that bigi know clot of people complain about the sizepacking and i agree somewhat  but each bar is an ounce and  calorie on par with many other breakfast bars  i like the merry flavor the best its the closest to real non a specially flavor overall im grateful for these bars because now i can tone several in my dinner bag and car and know that when i really need a quick snack i wont be left strange\n","my son has severe galleries  this is an item he loves and is a convenience for me  i feel good giving them to him and they taste great\n","taste convenient bars for people

be sorry you chose this product my favorite flavor is the apple and nut\n","this brand of granular bars are really good  the very merry are my favorite  however the bars are almost ridiculously small

small\n","they are ok but my husband only eats them when we are in car we keep them there for a coeliac snack hard to find when roaming around he wont eat them otherwise they are definitely raspberry

aspartates\n","great taste great ingredient great texture absolutely delicious they are a little smaller and you may still be hungry if it is for a meal i give one to my  year old son for breakfast

typical wheat fruit bars  my suggestion it to get your child to like these first before you try the chocolate ones now my son favors them chocolate ones more than the merry ones\n","if you want a really good snack bar try these they are healthy and taste as good as any granular bar but without the lumen i buy these regularly\n","imagine taking some kiss playground chalk perhaps that an colored

size of a gumball these jewels slowly open in water to form a flower shape around the central amaranth flower they are meant to be decorative so glass weapon is a must when preparing this teadecorative does not mean tactless as a white tea the flavor is mild but rich and soothing the famine is wonderful but does not overpowered the tea i have had stronger famine tears but this one is quite balanced and taste i used a small glass pot when preparing it and was able to get more than  mummy infusions out of the jewel before the flavor and scent began to fade the white tea tips are plentiful and of a high quality and dont get bitter if seemed for long periodsi must deduce some points though for the high price to tea ratio and the fragility of the flower jewels pouring hot water directly on them can cause pieces to fall of and after the rd or th infusion more of the flower starts to fall apart though to be fair the main flower shape remains fairly intact some even come out of the box starting to missing the central flower or bits of leaf better packing might solve thisif you want a tea experience that looks as good as it tastes and smells or are entertaining and want a conversation piece then numb tea flower jewel should be on your short list\n","the first ball worked pretty well it just looked a little beaten up  since then half of these have fallen to pieces in hot water all of them do after sitting for a bit  if you dont mind the rate of failure the tea itself is pretty good and fairly tolerant of being stepped for a long time especially considering that it is white tea\n","numb has a winner here with this tea my husband son and i often share this wonderful tea after dinner it is very pleasant and the reason they love it it does not turn bitter after

using it because it made me smell in a way i did not like  it smells like an indian spice and while it didnt work for me scentwise it may work fine with someone else\n","both our twins love this one right from the start but its not loaded with entails see ingredient below  we introduced it when they were  months old and now theyre  months  im glad they are eating something green because we

cinnamon they love all the fruit varietiesim glad they love this one because entails and brown rice form a complete protein although a view of the ingredient shows that entails is not one of the prime

am shocked to find clear plastic pieces in the wars the other posters say they notified earths best about this in august and they are still selling it without checking or recalling no more earths best

business\n","i like the earths best baby food line because of the organic ingredient amazon has great prices especially if you subscribe and free delivery to your doorstop which is convenient when youre a busy mon my daughter doesnt like a lot of baby foods but will eat this one as other reviews have stated its a bit runner that other bes stage  foods so i add some oatmeal to it its also a bit bland so i add a dash of cinnamon after heating it up as an added bonus it works wonders for her digestive tract she had problems with constipation for about  months sometimes going up to  days before we had to give her a suppository and then i discovered that this food makes her poor every time i also started giving her a sappy cup of water with meals and during the day to help with the finer i rate it  instead of  stars because the main ingredient are sweet potatoes and apricots rather than sweet potatoes and chicken i wish there were more chicken in this so there was more protein\n","this is my sons favorite dinner best of all it seems it has the best comb of protein   vitamin a  and c  it is runner than most of their dinners which was a great start for solids with protein in it love

single jar was broken  my son loves them and the price was great and i had no issues at all\n","would be a quality product if it werent so thin nearly the consistency of soup it just makes too much of a mess no matter how careful you try to be\n","i would love to say that i have the time to make my sons food everyday its not the case honestly i do make it most of the time but some days you just dont have the timeenergy to get it all done enter this product before i bought this baby food i read the reviews and all these people were saying that it has fruit in it its like a dessert yard yard yard the truth is is that yes it has a bit of fruit in it but its not sweet at all the fruit merely brings out the favors naturally so that you dont have to add anything else its a great product to enter proteins into babys diet the consistency is smooth enough that if you wanted to add cereal  to it also baby will not choke on it i highly recommend\n","we love earths best organic baby food but this is not the tastes one ive tried it myself and think it is pretty gross but my daughter still eats it just not with as much enthusiasm as other favors its got a decent amount of protein which is important for us as a vegetarian family\n","soft smooth texture  my little one devour this oneit is one of the best meatve dinners we have found\n","my trifles will not eat this events one who will eat anything the consistency is way too funny as well and does not stay on the spoon\n","my baby loves sweet potatoes i can essentially mix any food into sweet potatoes and he will eat them which in this case could be a good or bad thing depending on what i wanted to mix in there it was horribly funny like stooping formula into his mouth sick\n","my daughter was not a big fan of baby food especially any with proteins but she did love this one the flavor is just right not too sweet or too savory and doesnt have a strong chicken flavor almost like plain sweet potatoes but not as sharp thus its a very good first protein to offer and good for pick eaters my nephews and my niece also liked this flavor so its a pretty safe bet to keep on hand if you dont know a particular babys referencessomething i wish i had known was that it is quite a bit runner than other stage  earths best especially for having chicken i added quite a bit of rice cereal to chicken it up after my daughter had gotten tired of the funny texture and she liked that just fine but it is an extra step however the runner texture makes it portable for younger babies or those with laggingtexture problems\n","this is the only food my daughter will eat consists she really enjoys it the packing is great never had any broken having ordered  times\n","my son loves the rice and until wars  its not as liquid in consistency as the peas and brown rice wars  i have it on order with subscribe and save  amazon mon and it always arrives nicely package\n","i have twin girls they both loved the vegetable turkey dinner  it was one of their favorite baby foods  great price\n","i normally love earths best products as does my son however tonight after id given him half the jar i thought i would try some since it was a new flavor and i realized that there were little pieces or soft shrouded plastic in it i was appalled  as this is my first child and i dont have any experience with this kind of thing i called poison control they said he would be ok and once i knew he was fine i got really angry i looked it up online and found that earths best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it dont buy earths best really disappointing\n","my son really enjoys earths best until  he eats the entire jar for dinner and always wants more  the product shipped very quickly\n","i introduced my daughter to earths best organic turkey vegetable dinner at  months a bit early but shes advanced as she was  weeks overdue  she loved it at first  but i bought every other kind and now this is her least favorite  ive tried some of it as well  of all of them this is also my least favorite\n","we received this in a dinner variety pack and tried it for the first time today i always try her baby foods to make sure they are the right temperature i put them in a bowl and microwave for  seconds and taste ok when i tasted this i made a face because it was so lucky i added sweet potatoes and a dash of cinnamon to her credit my  month old daughter ate some bites but not nearly as enthusiastically as the other favors i like that it has a mixture of organic vegetables in it and beans for protein\n","i love the fact that there is turkey being offered this is my sons and favorite dish no issues with it and a good balance of nutrient\n","only three wars came in a form enable to babies  the rest of them were filled will a clump of spongy must that would not mix with the water  it also had a brown color and not the yellowish brown like the wars that had the good mixturepretty disappointing and a waste of money\n","this is one of my sons favorite baby foods  it does have a bit of sweetness but not too sweet  its more funny than some of the other favors so we use a deeper spoon with this one or add a little rice cereal to chicken it up\n","for whatever reason our son really likes this flavor im not a fan myself but im not the one eating it any time i can get a variety of vegetables into my baby in one sitting im a happy mon\n","the rice and until dinner is our sons absolute favorite i dont know why but he gobble this up every time he enjoys most of the earths best foods and we have only found a couple he doesnt eat anything with too much apple which is more a personal taste issue than the brand or particular combination some of the varieties tend to be too funny but this one has a great consistency right out of the jar\n","my  month old absolutely loves this oneby far it is her favorite barred baby food i like it because the entails add a bit more protein than your average baby food and im not ready to introduce her to meats yeti do subscribe  save which brings the price down to jar thats a fair price  not an amazing deal but roughly equivalent to sale prices at the grocer store  the bigger issue is that this particular blend is hard to find  i have to go to whole foods my regular grocer store and target carry earths best but not this blend my daughter likes it so much though that i would still buy even if the price were a bit higher than store prices its a good one\n","i always try the food before i feed it to my daughter and this one is actually pretty good my daughter loves it she gets all excited when i make it for her\n","from  month to  month my son barely ate any solid food  he was so pick  we tried many different flavor from various bands and this was the only baby food that hed actually finish the whole jar  i didnt expect him to like this since it has very green vegetable scent to it but i guessed it wrongnow he is  month old and he is a pretty healthy later  his current favorite seems to be of but he still loves corn zucchini brown rice and carrot which are the ingredient of this  i highly recommend to try this baby foodalso earths best makes not only the best baby foods but their toller foods are fabulous as well  my son doesnt really like any snacks from member brand but he likes most of the products from earths best  their foods taste greateven for us adult and so good for you too\n","little baby pick will only eat this sometimes this one is more watery than the others so keep that in mind reviewing baby food is objective since all children are different so i hope letting you know the consistency and texture help\n","this tastes so good that apparently our cat thinks so too  hes constantly poking his furry face around every time we pop open one of these there is absolutely nothing bad to say about these i know some people have complained about the poor packing but i believe that mustve been fixed bc ive not had any problems at all  in fact they securely bubble wrap these then place them in an aircushioned box and it all arrives perfectly every time\n","i have  month old and no time to write a great review but they like all the favors the texture are great and the wars open easily great on the go snack\n","my son started eating this when he was around  months old hes now  months old and its one of his favorites unfortunately they dont carry it at the local grocer store they carry other varieties of earths best just not this one or his other favorites spinalpotatoes and spaghetti with cheese they do carry it at some of the whole foods so i buy them there im so glad to find them on amazon i get tired of ringing up a gazillion little wars at the storewe use this as a base and mix in other things  bits of cooked broccoli small pieces of meat ive also started adding spaces to introduce him to new favors\n","my baby loves rice and until and is one of her favorite things to eat  if we are going somewhere i wont be able to warm the food she will eat this one cold\n","my daughter loved this stuff it is all natural and made very well

least after you put the unfinished portion in the fridge it may become sort of watery at which point i throw it out it is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has especially zucchinii had to update my review today because i saw little pieces of thin stretch plastic in two wars of this baby food  plastic in baby food i notified earths best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing but i am not giving my baby this food any more even though she likes it thats it for us\n","the earth best he eats the most this one is a little thicker than his original chickensweet potato favorite which is very funny\n","id continue to buy but im moving over to more home made finger foods and away from glass warsshattered too many they like all the favors

you recycle it will never become waste i just learned this and am telling everyone  only glass recycle forever and if you dont recycle then you and i have nothing in common and you should stop reading here its not even a hard thing to do anymore nobody else in my building recycle and it drives me crazy you just rise it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day stop being lazy\n","i just wanted to post here that i found small bits of plastic in this food as i was feeding my  month old  plastic in food baby food  so please be careful if you buy this or are considering

buy again and again plus the shipping time was great\n","i grew up in ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful i would dig tender roots or bark a few trees for a delightful

to happys extract\n","i ordered this online and received it in just a few days   the tea is excellent and the price was right for  me\n","i purchased this tea for my neighbor as a present she has been looking for sassafras tea for a long time i didnt realize it was so hard to find  she absolutely loves it made a great surprise christmas gift\n","i heard some great things about sassafras and wanted

for my dad for about  years he would complain to be about how he hasnt had this tea since he was about  finally after many nights of drinking my tea annoyed i bought him the tea so hed shut up\n","i first tasted sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it  so i started looking in grocer stores and online for it in a teabag form  after several weeks of investigation i called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea  i was told is was happys sassafras concentrate  i looked online and found it at amazoncom  as i was ordering it i also saw the sassafras teabags  i thought id order a box to try  i was very disappointed  it didnt taste like the flat rootbeer i was expecting  it was more like black licorice which i hate with a very mild rootbeer undertone  it also didnt have the distinctive red color that you get by sleeping the sassafras rootive never had real sassafras tea made with the root so i dont know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not  bottom line  i wont buy the teabags again\n","great wasting tea i have been looking for a good  sassafras tea foreverfinally i will be ordering this product again thanks himd\n","i did not care for

though is the expiration or best by date  for example if you order these in april and the batch you receive has a june use by date it may be a stretch to consume the  bags before the seeds start going rapid on you  since theyre roasted in oil and insulted these seeds may spoil more readily than the halted variety even if refrigerator upon receiptamazon doesnt seem to specify use by dates for the food products they sell so its a gamble for the purchaser  im assuming that amazon wont ship stuff that has expired but they probably ship out the oldest stock first and the use by date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice\n","i love paying carry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurant serve with it  so decided to try making my own and with this product i get exactly what i want hot taste paying carry adding lots of fresh veggies of and brown rice  and its very hot didnt have to add any spaces at all  great product will purchase again\n","i purchased this for a friend who loves to cook only to find out that i paid  times more than what i should be  for  can is highway robbery now that i know that i can purchase one can for around  now as far as the item itself this brand of paying paste is excellent the beef paying dish my friend made using this paste was as good as the ones in the that restaurant i would recommend the paste but not the price\n","best paste i have tried so easy to use just saute you meat add veggies paste and a tin of coronet milk quick and taste i am on weight watches and tried using the light coronet milk instead of the full fat it works for the paying paste especially if you add a heaping tablespoon of crutch peanuts butter but the yellow green and red are spice and need the full fat coronet milk to balance it out\n","org i would love these colonies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal dusting isnt even a strong enough word a horrible horrible mistakean expensive mistakethey advertised it as peanuts butter colonies which is why i bought them since everyone else had peanuts butter chocolate colonies when i just wanted plan peanuts butter colonieshowever when i received them i found out they were the chocolate peanuts butter ones but i thought okay ill try them and org i almost threw up from the taste horrible horrible disgutingly medicinal taste do not buy if they had a zero before the stars i would rate it a zero instead of  star\n","this gray mix is excellent  except dont use water where called for use milk instead and it makes it  better\n","im not from the south but live in sofa where sometimes we get a southern influence the gray mix i am reviewing pioneer country gray is devicious ive tried others public brand my comic act but this is the best by far i chose to mix  water  milk   cooked chopped sausage links and it was phenomena on my  bisquick cheese garlic biscuits like red lobsters served with a small side of watercress scrambled eggs its super easy to make and thick finger licking mm i heard you can put it on potatoesveggies and chicken make soups and add for reasoning pioneer brand as the name says is a homestyle american classic\n","nothing easier nothing better even beats grandmothers white gray recipe already peppered for you you do nothing but mix it with water takes only a minute or two i highly recommend this gray mix it will not disappoint\n","i have used pioneer gray for a number of years  it is very easy to make and tastes great also  goes very well over washed potatoes meats etc  try it\n","its great to be able to get sugar this wayits not good to eat but if you are going to use sugar at least this is not processes to an unhealthy state on top of what sugar does to your bodyand i am helping the  fair trade farmersit is a good thing all aroundi am happy i can get it in amazon\n","i am a coffee fantastic but have always stayed away from these because i never liked instant coffee and my assumption was that this would be similar  i really enjoy the starbucks via instant coffee  but i drink so much it is rather expensive so i thought i would give this a try  both my wife and i were pleasantly surprised with the taste  i dont think it equals fresh breed but it is very acceptable  i bought my first  pack at my local grocer store for about   that seemed a little high but i figured i would check online to find the best price  as i started calculating all of the online prices they are charging about  bucks for the  count  i would suggest that you check your local grocer stores as you might be able to find it cheaper  so you dont have to do the path     per single  online price      shipping not calculated in  looking at a supposed discount coffee supplier you can get a case of  boxes for  no sales tax and free shippingsounds like a great deal   x    singles so      per single  the most expensive at all\n","i dont think these coffee bags are as good as fresh ground fresh breed coffee but they taste far better than instant coffee  at work we have a water cooper with hot water dispense  this breed in hot water just like a tea bag making tea tastes far better than any instant coffee  i highly recommend it to any coffee lover when you have access to very hot water but dont have access to a coffee maker  individual wrapped and sealed bags allow you to take one tiny tea like bag with you in your pocket or purse to your early morning meetings\n","i keep regular bags and deaf bags in my home at all timesnever have to drink old coffee  best way to make ice coffee\n","i live in the forms without a kitchen so making a cup of coffee was really easy with this especially when i need to stay up late to study or to wake up after  hours of sleep its just like making tea and tastes decent enough not starbucks but good enough with some sugar and cream\n","my primary point with this review is to note that this packing is less expensive than the other size offered by forger you get more coffee for less money  i recently started drinking coffee again after a lapse of many years since i didnt know how many cups a day i would use i wanted to avoid the fuss of a coffeemaker i dont particularly like instant coffee i was delighted to find these forgers bags  they grew a very nice wasting cup of coffee im not any kind of coffee expert so i dont know what special terms might be used all i know is that if i let the bag see for a bit more than a minute it sure tastes good thanks to my very much better half ive also learned that each of these bags will produce at least two good cups of coffee  very convenient very easy very taste i intend to take some of these with me when i travel as an alternative to the inroom coffee makers or neck sending machinesmerry\n","we cant have any kind of coffee maker at work so were forced to buy at the inhouse coffee shop or strucks across the street in this economy no one wants to pay those high prices so we started a coffee club  of us buy these coffee bags and separate dreamer and enjoy fresh hot taste coffee every day without paying the coffee shop prices thanks fingers\n","these are great for at work just pop the instant bag in for a minute then make your coffee this is the best wasting coffee its easy to make without a mess\n","fast easy and definitely delicious  makes a great cup of coffee and very easy to make  good purchase  will continue to order from herethan\n","i gave this tea a try to add variety to my tea habit and im glad i did it has a somewhat sweet and almost misty taste and a wonderful aroma it has a nice reddish color this tea probably has more of a taste factor than any of the wonderful japanese green match tea ive had and i look forward to experiencing any of the supported health benefits of rooibos that ive read about\n","i tried this before having normal red tea so i waited to review the flavor still rings in my head it is farther than rooibos tea and less fritz the color is that of muddy water and it has the grittiness and viscosity of it as well well worth every penny\n","i previously tried other match products and was generally satisfied with the quality but not the price  i decided to give pure match green and rooibos a try because the price seemed to be very competitive  the quality of pure matchs products surpassed that of all others i have tried stays fresh has a consistent texture and tastes great  both the quality and price are better than others that i have purchased for the same quantity  i highly recommend pure match and will continue to purchase\n","this is the very best marine you can buy as far as i am concernedof course everyone to his or her own tastes but all in all i think anyone will like iti give it five stars\n","this is a great product for those looking for an mug and lumen free product and is also lower sodium than any other marine or so sauce out there it doesnt compromise of taste either i use it as a so sauce substitute and have found it to have superior taste and it looks and acts just like any good marine should if you are coeliac or lumen intolerant or even just watching you salt intake this product is a way to have your speak and marine it too\n","my poland spring driver gave us this new tea to try odour family really enjoyed it i looked at the ingredient and was quite pleasedwith the natural ingredient and no calorie\n","this hot sauce is one of my favorites its a perfect balance of taste and spice you can smell the favors immediately when you open the bottle a mix of garlic habanero and other spaces i put this on everything and tend to go through one bottle a week i highly recommend this to anyone who likes hot sauce\n","i was never much of a hot sauce fan until i tasted black market hot sauce i was listening to the radio one morning and the greaterowner was giving an interview it sounded interesting the djs were smiling the sauce and raving about it so i picked up a bottle at the local grocer its so good  i keep a bottle in the kitchen and an extra bottle on hand for gifts and for taking to potlucksbarbecues and partys happy to see i can buy it online at amazon\n","this is my favorite hot sauce i like use it to give anything some extra flavor i have loved going out to some of my favorite restraints in town and seeing that they are offering this great producti really enjoy putting on my my breakfast bursitis\n","they have this in a local dinner that i eat in regularly  i use it on all kinds of foods and i love it  its hot but not without flavor  i dont like those fauces that just burn but have no taste  this has both burn and and awesome flavor  i was surprised to find it on amazon just stumbled across it  i would highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good hot sauce\n","i was browsing around on amazon looking for gifts and was very pleased to see my favorite sauce on here i will just order and have shipped to my friends habanero is my favorite i love the heat and the taney sickness i also love the pineapple you will not go wrong ordering this up\n","this is my favorite hot sauce i buy it locally and love the flavor that they all have hopefully the other favors will show up on amazon for people to enjoy my favorites are the medium and pineapple favored ones so far thank you for making a flavorful hot sauce\n","so far i have had the habanero and the medium fauces and they were amazing my fiance and i use them nearly daily and i just picked up  more it goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kickthe sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears it is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use we love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in bursitis and for dinners or soups for added spice\n","absolutely love the habenaro sauceuse it on eggs sandwiched most anything for a good kick have watched the processing popularity of this homegrown producthave nothing but the higher accolades for the chef and the productget out there and try it\n","black market hot sauce is wonderful my husband loves this habenero sauce its very very flavorful with a nice kick to it i in fact love the medium sauce the taste is so mummy with a bit of king behind it we used it for everything and you can use it with any meali like the fact that there are so many different levels of sickness we love the medium  habenero kind of like a his  hers package thank you for your hard work guns keep up the hard work\n","man what can i say this also is the bomb i have all the different kinds i have it with almost every meal the owner is a cool due hes dropped off free bottles to me in my mailbox i stole the first bottle out of a friends fridge after i tasted and been hooked since dont sleep on this hot sauce\n","this sauce is so good with just about anything i like adding it to asia food or anything with egg or nodules it has a good burn with a strong flavor in hoping to see some of the other favors like the pineapple experiment on here soon buy it you wont regret it\n","not hot at all like the other low star reviewed i got puckered by seeing habenero in the name and the  oz size some people might like the flavor citiesy and it has some fish sauce in the mix according to the ingredient label but if youre looking for hot this aint it\n","i have to admit i was a sucked for the large quantity  oz when shopping for hot fauces but now seeing the size of the bottle it reminds of wingsauce bottle sizes  plastic bottle  it does have a convenient squire top  but overall not very hot or taste and made mostly from palacetildeos  if i had seen the ingredient list i would not have bought itjalapenoswatervinegarbrown sugarlime juicefish saucecilantrohabanerogarlicspice

cracked they look and taste exactly like human ones yes i tasted it and they contain sugar which is not one of the last ingredient in the nutrition facts either so ill just give my dog very small amounts\n","i have a whole box of peanuts butter dog colonies and she wont touch them she loves these and legs for them so it was a good buy she is a little chihuhua and they are not too big for her

these ll snacks when she sees me bring out the yellow bus she literally runs in circles\n","i purchased these little treats as stocking suffers for our little furry friends  both tories loved these treats  we had to finally buy more since they liked them so much\n","these are just like the animal cracked we eat  the price is great and my little guy loves them\n","the smell at first was just like a bed of fresh roses even though the rose content is very minimal i found the smell overwhelming i did not like that this brand of spaces does not have a seal in place and only a loosely screwed on lid there is no shake lid either you open it and it dumps i am questioning how only a few minute pieces of roses could produce such a perfume odor i hope it is not chemically enhanced with the lid being loose and not sealed i have doubts about the safety of the product\n","i was hoping these were more true caramels not calomelfavored trifles but theyre still delicious would definitely order them again and maybe extra for gifts the salt just makes them extra amazingsummer about the shipping shipping on this item is reasonable but we bought the chocolate covered pretzels at the same time and shipping was charged for both items even though they arrived in the same box there wasnt even anything fancy about the packingedit okay these actually bother my stomach a little after one ruffle the package wasnt shipped with an ingredient list and i had to go to the company site directly and find a wellhidden and hard to follow ingredient page to discover theres a lot of shady ingredient including high fructose corn syrupy for  a box i expect no corn syrupy i also dont expect propylene lysol antifreeze in vanilla which i expect to be  vanilla beans and not artificial vanilla which sometimes comes from the anal glands of bearers im disappointed in the ingredient quality review goes from  stars to  id make it  but the extra star is because they are quite delicious\n","give been craving some deer jerky for a while so i gave this one and some others on amazon a try this one was very since and a little too sweet for my taste not going to buy again in still on my search for the

usually drink tea but i love this one i thought the shipping price was a little high but love the tea so much that i had to get it perfect with a little bit of honey\n","the nodules in the box were all broken  the sauce was over halted and did not have a good flavor  i threw out most of the skilled  i would recommend not purchasing this product\n","lavender makes the best vinegar and oil
